  abstract = {There has been a dramatic increase in wind power supply due to the growing demand for renewable energy sources across the globe. In this process, technological advancements have led to the emergence of more so\- phisticated wind turbines with higher hubs and larger swept areas to reduce the unit costs for power generation. However, there is also a growing concern about the visibility impacts of wind turbines. Spatial modelling of the potential visibility of wind turbines holds strategic information for wind power siting decisions. The visibility information is critical to breaking trade-offs between energy production and protecting the visual amenity of landscapes. Currently, public attention to the visual impacts of wind turbines tends to rise in countries with high wind power capacities. Decreases in property values due to wind turbine visibility and negative impacts on scenery are among the factors that draw public attention. These implications make it necessary to use spatial analysis and develop mitigation strategies based on the geospatial outputs. This paper aims to produce Potential Visibility Models (PVM) to analyse wind turbine visibility from candidate observation locations where the scenery is an important asset. These are residential buildings (RB), protected areas (PA), natural and archaeo\- logical sites (NAS), tourism development centres (TDC), roads (RD), and the coastal areas (CS). The results showed that potential turbine visibility varied across the study area considering the five qualitative visibility classes. The areas with ``very low'' and ``low'' potential visibility were proposed as candidate areas of low visual impact for wind power generation.},

Until the early 2000s, most of the types of vegetation have remained natural/virgin forests and shrubs until recent years, when human activities have damaged them. Understanding the different ways that people value such endangered forest resources is very important. The main hypothesis in our study is that willingness to pay (WTP) for forest existence value and sustainability depends on the preference for the same values. In addition, we examined socioeconomic characteristics, such as sex, education, and household incomes, which could influence the WTP for forest existence value and sustainability. We carried out field questionnaire interviews with the aim of ascertaining Willingness to Pay (WTP) for forest existence. The WTP values were in a range between 1 and 200 USD based on the contingent valuation method (CVM). A sample with a size of 203 was interviewed in selected towns and villages in Uganda, and the data collected were subjected to statistical analysis. The cross-tabulation of the expressed preferences illustrates that 81.9\% of the representative sample are willing to pay for forest existence value and sustainability. We concluded that the willingness to pay for forest existence significantly depends on the preference for forest existence values and sustainability. Our results equally express that the mean WTP in this region is 15 USD per year and that over 60\% are willing to pay this amount. The socioeconomic determinants' results demonstrate heterogeneity and that over 90\% of the respondents are willing to pay for forest existence, conservation, and sustainability.},

  abstract = {Extensively managed grasslands are recognized globally for their high biodiversity and their social and cultural values. However, their capacity to deliver multiple ecosystem services (ES) as parts of agricultural systems is surprisingly understudied compared to other production systems. We undertook a comprehensive overview of ES provided by natural and semi-natural grasslands, using southern Africa (SA) and northwest Europe as case studies, respectively. We show that these grasslands can supply additional nonagricultural services, such as water supply and flow regulation, carbon storage, erosion control, climate mitigation, pollination, and cultural ES. While demand for ecosystems services seems to balance supply in natural grasslands of SA, the smaller areas of semi-natural grasslands in Europe appear to not meet the demand for many services. We identified three bundles of related ES from grasslands: water ES including fodder production, cultural ES connected to livestock production, and population-based regulating services (e.g., pollination and biological control), which also linked to biodiversity. Greenhouse gas emission mitigation seemed unrelated to the three bundles. The similarities among the bundles in SA and northwestern Europe suggest that there are generalities in ES relations among natural and semi-natural grassland areas. We assessed trade-offs and synergies among services in relation to management practices and found that although some trade-offs are inevitable, appropriate management may create synergies and avoid trade-offs among many services. We argue that ecosystem service and food security research and policy should give higher priority to how grasslands can be managed for fodder and meat production alongside other ES. By integrating grasslands into agricultural production systems and land-use decisions locally and regionally, their potential to contribute to functional landscapes and to food security and sustainable livelihoods can be greatly enhanced.},

This paper attempts to estimate the magnitude of these external costs and benefits for the case of renewable technologies in Scotland, a country which has set particularly ambitious targets for expanding renewable energy. The external effects we consider are those on landscape quality, wildlife and air quality. We also consider the welfare implications of different investment strategies for employment and electricity prices. The methodology used to do this is the choice experiment technique. Renewable technologies considered include hydro, onshore and off-shore wind power and biomass. Welfare changes for different combinations of impacts associated with different investment strategies are estimated. We also test for differences in preferences towards these impacts between urban and rural communities, and between high- and low-income households.},

Cultural services (particularly the aesthetic and recreational values of the landscape), supporting services (biodiversity maintenance) and some regulating services (particularly fire risk prevention) were clearly recognized by both farmers and citizens, with different degrees of importance according to their particular interests and objectives. The prevention of forest fires ({$\approx$}50\% of total willingness to pay) was valued by the general population as a key ecosystem service delivered by these agroecosystems, followed by the production of specific quality products linked to the territory ({$\approx$}20\%), biodiversity ({$\approx$}20\%) and cultural landscapes ({$\approx$}10\%). The value given by local residents to the last two ecosystem services differed considerably ({$\approx$}10 and 25\% for biodiversity and cultural landscape, respectively).

  abstract = {Existing research relating to visual impact of wind turbines (WTs) affirms this to be an essential parameter for public acceptance in most cases as well as for the planning process and permitting of planned wind farms. This study brings new findings about the impact of two crucial factors: numbers of WTs (1\textendash 25) visible and distances of WTs (0.75\textendash 15 km) from the observer (e.g. from residential buildings, landmarks, observation points). Photographs of three aesthetically varying landscapes with various numbers of WTs (Vestas V90, height 105 m, rotor diameter 90 m) at various distances were evaluated in terms of visual preferences. The results show significant effect from the aesthetic value of a given landscape on the impact of both tested factors. An important finding is that the landscape with the highest aesthetic quality initially was evaluated to be the absolute worst after the addition of WTs and vice versa. Increasing numbers of WTs in the least attractive landscape had less visual impact than did doing so in the two more attractive landscapes. This helps explain strong public opposition to locating WTs in aesthetically valuable landscapes and their greater acceptance in less-attractive landscapes. Increasing stepwise from 1 to 25 WTs within a given landscape progressively decreased visual preferences, although the cumulative effect of a higher number of WTs was not confirmed. We also established threshold distances after which the negative visual impact of a WT disappeared (10 km for the most attractive landscape, 5 km for the least attractive one). Based on these findings, visibility zones were proposed for practical assessment of WTs' visual impact. The study's results can make a substantial contribution towards reducing negative visual impact in WT planning and thus achieving greater public acceptance of these devices.},

This is achieved through an on-line survey involving an 18 turbine wind farm at three different distances (4, 8 and 12 km), in five different lighting and weather conditions and in two different movement conditions. Distance and contrast were found to be very good predictors of perceived impact. There was a significant difference in impact between simulations with moving and stationary blades.

Using a combination of site-specific primary field data, benefits transfer and modelling, we show that for our sites restoration for nature conservation provides a more diverse array of ecosystem services than would be delivered under an agricultural restoration scenario. We also explore the effects of addressing different conservation targets, which we find alter the provision of ecosystem services on a service-specific basis. Highly species-focused intervention areas are associated with increased carbon storage and livestock grazing provision, whereas non-intervention areas are important for carbon sequestration, fishing, recreation and flood risk mitigation. The results of this study highlight the wider societal importance of restored mineral sites and may help conservation managers and planners to develop future restoration strategies that provide benefits for both biodiversity and human well-being.},

  abstract = {Renewable energy will play a crucial role in the future society of the 21st century. The various renewable energy sources need to be balanced and their use carefully planned since they are characterized by high temporal and spatial variability that will pose challenges to maintaining a well balanced supply and to the stability of the grid. This article examines the ways that future `energy landscapes' can be modelled in time and space. Biomass needs a great deal of space per unit of energy produced but it is an energy carrier that may be strategically useful in circumstances where other renewable energy carriers are likely to deliver less. A critical question considered in this article is whether a massive expansion in the use of biomass will allow us to construct future scenarios while repositioning the `energy landscape' as an object of study. A second important issue is the utilization of heat from biomass energy plants. Biomass energy also has a larger spatial footprint than other carriers such as, for example, solar energy. This article seeks to provide a bridge between energy modelling and spatial planning while integrating research and techniques in energy modelling with Geographic Information Science. This encompasses GIS, remote sensing, spatial disaggregation techniques and geovisualization. Several case studies in Austria and Germany demonstrate a top-down methodology and some results while stepwise calculating potentials from theoretical to technically feasible potentials and setting the scene for the definition of economic potentials based on scenarios and assumptions.},

Geographical and socioeconomic factors and sociodemographic characteristics that affect local community perceptions of landscape disruption are explored using correlations and a regression analysis model. The results suggest that the expressed perception of landscape disruption is not determined by the number of existing wind turbines, the proximity of residences to them and their visibility from the home but is significantly affected by the perception of the economic favourability of projects (benefits to local communities), perception of other negative impacts of wind turbines (particularly the noise annoyance) and the socio-cultural background of people (particularly the level of education).},

  abstract = {Ecosystem compensation and exchange programs require benefit analysis in order to guarantee that compensation or trades preserve the social benefits lost when ecosystems are destroyed or degraded. This study derives, applies, and critiques a set of ecosystem benefit indicators (EBIs). Organized around the concept of ecosystem services and basic valuation principles we show how GIS mappings of the physical and social landscape can improve understanding of the ecosystem benefits arising from specific ecosystems. The indicator system focuses on landscape factors that limit or enhance an ecosystem's ability to provide services and that limit or enhance the expected value of those services. The analysis yields an organized, descriptive, and numerical depiction of sites involved in specific mitigation projects. Indicatorbased evaluations are applied to existing wetland mitigation projects in Florida and Maryland in order to practically illustrate the virtues and limitations of the approach.},

Our findings reveal that the majority of respondents are willing to make (monetary) tradeoffs to allow for wind power initiatives and we find that respondents require less compensation if provision is made for a community representative and setback distance is increased.},

However, the existing studies primarily rely on interview data and simple bivariate statistics. In contrast, we make use of secondary statistics on tourism and wind turbine locations at the level of German municipalities. Using spatial panel regression techniques, we confirm a negative relation between wind turbines around municipalities and tourism demand for municipalities not located near the coast. In the latter regions, the relation between wind turbines and tourism demand is more complex.},

The evaluation of the landscape's capacity to absorb the changes was effectuated by defining criteria which take into consideration the possible impact of photovoltaic sites on the landscape. These criteria were used to evaluate the sensitivity of the characteristics of the landscape as well as its quality and value, and the visual impact of the proposed changes. Most of the Landscape Units were found to be not suitable for photovoltaic parks because of the high value of the land. However, protected agricultural land, mainly used for greenhouses, has a medium to high capacity to host photovoltaic plants, and if these are correctly planned, this could help to lower the sensitivity levels.},

The total figure is \texteuro 78 billion, the greatest losses coming from North America and Mexico, followed by Africa, Russia and some Asiatic countries. Most of this loss is attributable to provisioning services and carbon sequestration, while only a minor part is due to loss of cultural services. In terms of biomes the greatest losses are from boreal and warm mixed forests, followed by tropical forests. These results may be surprising to some who argue that it is the loss of tropical forests, particularly the Amazon, that is the most significant. A detailed analysis, shows, however, that this is not the case. The best estimates point to greater losses in areas where use and non-use values are highest, which includes North America.},

This Ontario case study compares simulated photographs submitted as part of a VIA with post-development conditions. Simulations were judged for accuracy in turbine number, height, diameter, and location, and adequacy in representation of built conditions. Simulations were partially representative of postdevelopment conditions, yet commonly under-represented turbine number and size in different locations than they were built. Simulation frames were too narrow to adequately represent human vision and simulations under-estimated how many wind turbines were visible from a single landscape position. Outcomes suggest that visual simulations can lack accuracy or representativeness, misleading the public. Adopting province-wide VIA criteria and increasing adherence to visual simulation guidance may be necessary to improve the accuracy and representativeness of VIA content.},

In light of the experience gained in this field, the challenge of a controlled and consistent integration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) requires a careful reflection on the compatibility criteria between new technologies and traditional building's identity. Several of these technologies, such as photovoltaic (PV) systems, need to be placed on the building envelope or in appropriate outdoor areas, altering the architectural image and the landscape. Therefore, the characteristics of each building and its context should lead designers to choose solutions able to balance the need for increased energy production from RES with the need for preserving the identity of architectural heritage and landscape. A preliminary evaluation of rehabilitation projects allows to improve building sustainability and, in the meanwhile, to prevent any irreversible alteration of the cultural heritage. With reference to Italian case studies and guidelines for improving sustainability in energy production, the paper leads to identify evaluation criteria for the introduction of PV systems in pre-industrial buildings. Such criteria, which are based on architectural heritage values, allow for assessing the consistency of the building envelope alteration with conservation issues, in projects involving PV and, generally, solar technologies that need to be integrated with the building envelope.},

Empirical data is provided from a case study of a proposed 750 MW offshore wind farm in North Wales, using group discussions and questionnaires distributed to local residents in two coastal towns (n {$\frac{1}{4}$} 488). Results indicate significant differences between each town's residents in their responses to the project, and how opposition arises from nature/industry symbolic contradictions: between a place represented in terms of scenic beauty that provides a restorative environment for residents and visitors, and a wind farm that will industrialise the area and `fence' in the bay. In one of the towns, the data suggests that contradiction between project and place was experienced as a threat to identity for those with strong place attachment, leading to negative attitudes and oppositional behaviour. Levels of trust in key actors moderated the relation between place attachment and negative attitudes to the wind farm. The results provide further evidence of the role of place attachment in shaping so-called `NIMBY' responses to development proposals, and challenge the assumption that offshore wind farms will prove less controversial than those onshore.},

To this end, the choice experiment methodology was employed in communities in two Greek Aegean Islands to assess the determinants of preferences towards different wind-farm projects. Unlike other studies, the willingness to accept welfare measure was adopted. The results of our analysis show that the conservation status of the area where the wind farms are to be installed, along with the governance characteristics of the planning procedure are the most important determinants of local community welfare in relation to wind farms. In contrast to other studies, we find that the physical attributes of wind farms appear to be of less relative importance from a local community welfare point of view. Implications for the EU's future energy policy are drawn.},

We propose that such conflicts can be mitigated by a welfare-optimal spatial allocation of WT in the landscape so that a given energy target is reached at minimum social costs. The energy target is motivated by the fact that wind power production is associated with relatively low CO2 emissions. Social costs comprise energy production costs as well as external costs caused by harmful impacts on humans and biodiversity. We present a modeling approach that combines spatially explicit ecological\textendash economic modeling and choice experiments to determine the welfare-optimal spatial allocation of WT in West Saxony, Germany. The welfare-optimal sites balance production and external costs. Results indicate that in the welfareoptimal allocation the external costs represent about 14\% of the total costs (production costs plus external costs). Optimizing wind power production without consideration of the external costs would lead to a very different allocation of WT that would marginally reduce the production costs but strongly increase the external costs and thus lead to substantial welfare losses.},

  abstract = {Following the success of two trial wind turbines, the national power company of Iceland, Landsvirkjun, proposed a wind farm at B\'urfellslundur on the edge of the Icelandic highlands. The farm would comprise of 67 turbines with combined production capacity of 200 MW. The Environmental Impact Assessment for the development raised concerns about the visual impacts of the proposals on the surrounding countryside. In this study, the contingent valuation method was applied to evaluate preferences and estimate willingness to pay to preserve B\'urfellslundur. This study represents only the third contribution in the international academic literature concerning the economic value of the environmental costs of developing wind farms, and the first focused on onshore resources. In addition, this paper fulfills a call by the OECD, who have requested that Iceland commence economic valuation of the environmental impacts of energy projects. A web-based contingent valuation survey was developed and issued by the University of Iceland's Social Science Research Institute, receiving 690 respondents. Of these, 28\% were willing to pay for preservation. Interval regression using log-transformation was applied to estimate mean willingnessto-pay, which was 12,549 ISK (approximately US \$128). When scaled up to the Icelandic population of taxpayers, the economic value of preserving B\'urfellslundur was estimated to be 3.17 billion ISK (approximately US \$32.3 million). These results are of a scale that could have a significant impact on the social welfare gains or losses associated with B\'urfellslundur, and inform the international land-use management debate concerning the trade-offs of developing wind farms.},

The method applied is a choice experiment where people are asked to choose between two hypothetical wind farms characterized by different attributes. Five attributes are included in the experiment: (i) type of landscape, (ii) type of ownership, (iii) the degree of local participation in the planning process, (iv) the choice to transfer revenue to the society in a pre-specified way, and (v) a monetary cost in terms of an additional electricity certificate fee. The data are analyzed with multinomial logit, random parameter logit, and latent class models. The results indicate that consumers in Sweden are more likely to accept the higher renewable electricity certificate fee if: (a) wind power farms in areas used for recreational purposes are substantially avoided, (b) the establishment is anchored by whole or partial ownership in the local community and, (c) the locals are involved in the planning and implementation process. Our policy simulation exercise shows that respondents are willing to pay a higher electricity fee corresponding to about 0.6 Euro cents per kWh to avoid wind farms located in the mountainous area and private ownership.},

Statistically comparing different methodological approaches, different distance decay effects with different distance weights and different GIS algorithms, we conclude that (a) large-area visual sensitivity analyses are possible, (b) the distance decay effect has a negligible influence on the spatial distribution of visual sensitivity and (c) that there are more methodological questions that should be empirically investigated in order to base strategic wind farm siting decisions on a valid information basis.},

Results indicate the wind park imposes welfare losses to local residents and non-local recreational users, with about 35\% of these losses corresponding to non-use values. Findings show that households prefer public compensation to private compensation, with household's willingness to accept being lower with public compensation than private compensation.

Seascape and place emerge as useful conceptual bridges linking ecosystem functioning outcomes to key CES values. We then relate this to offshore wind farming, which some residents perceive as a significant threat to certain CES. Although the approach presented increases the visibility of intangible ecosystem values, the problem remains that such assessments are temporal, in need of added calibration and do not automatically put intangibles on a par with market ecosystem value.},

  abstract = {Alpine regions provide diverse ecosystem goods and services (ES) to human society. Yet as many of these ES are not bought or sold, their value must be estimated using a surrogate for observable behavior witnessed in the marketplace. The present article reviews ES valuation studies conducted in the European Alps. In addition, we present the results of a case study where we integrated the value of selected ES (avalanche protection, scenic beauty values, C-sequestration, habitats of capercaillie [Tetrao urogallus]) into the planning of new settlement areas in the tourism resort of Davos (Swiss Alps). Benefit estimates derived from the economic valuation studies tend to be specific to a particular method, ecosystem, and socioeconomic circumstance. The case study shows, however, that consideration of ES values can help identify the most beneficial locations for new development if appropriate selection of ES is made, and if these ES can be valued in a spatially explicit form. The achievements of research to date indicate that accounting for the value of multiple ES in an Alpine region will increasingly make important information available to planners.},

  abstract = {Planning frequently fails to include the valuation of public goods and services. This can have long-term negative economic consequences for a region. This is especially the case in mountainous regions such as the Alps, which depend on tourism and where land-use changes can negatively impact key ecosystem services and hence the economy. In this study, we develop a semi-automatic procedure to value ecosystem goods and services. Several existing process-based models linked to economic valuation methods are integrated into a geographic information system (GIS) platform. The model requires the input of a digital elevation model, a land-cover map, and a spatially explicit temperature dataset. These datasets are available for most regions in Europe. We illustrate the approach by valuing four ecosystem services: avalanche protection, timber production, scenic beauty, and habitat, which are supplied by the "Landschaft Davos", an administrative district in the Swiss Alps. We compare the impacts of a human development scenario and a climate scenario on the value of these ecosystem services. Urban expansion and tourist infrastructure developments have a negative impact on scenic beauty and habitats. These impacts outweigh the benefits of the developments in the long-term. Forest expansion, predictable under a climate change scenario, favours natural avalanche protection and habitats. In general, such non-marketed benefits provided by the case-study region more than compensate for the costs of forest maintenance. Finally, we discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the approach. Despite its limitations, we show how this approach could well help decision-makers balance the impacts of different planning options on the economic accounting of a region, and guide them in selecting sustainable and economically feasible development strategies. \textcopyright{} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

We use a willingness to accept framework to measure the compensation required to allow wind generation windmills to be built in the mountains of North Carolina. We find that individuals who perceive wind energy as a clean source of power require less compensation. Those who retire to the mountains or individuals who have ancestors from Watauga County require more compensation to accept windmills in their viewshed. In addition, we find in a bivariate-probit analysis that individuals who are more likely to participate in a green energy program are also more likely to allow electrical generation windmills in their viewshed, suggesting that the green vs. green environmental debate is overstated.},

Utilizing a survey and quantitative analysis, we have identified the factors that are correlated with local acceptance of wind power in China. We conducted our study in the city of Jiuquan, Gansu Province, which currently possesses the largest installed capacity for wind power generation in China. Two factors, namely, perceived economic benefits and perceived environmental costs, influence local acceptance of wind power in China most significantly. Local acceptance of wind power in China can be described as ``not in my backyard, but not far away from me''. In other words, the acceptance rate is lowest when the source of wind power is located in their village or community, highest when the project is located in their county and city and decreases for projects that are constructed further away.},

  abstract = {Summary Expansion of renewable energies ({$\frac{1}{4}$} RE) is a key measure in climate change mitigation. For this expansion mountainous areas are regarded as specifically suitable because of their high-energy potential. However, mountains also are biodiversity hot-spots and provide scenic landscapes and therefore offer high natural and cultural value. Preserving this natural and cultural value whilst intensifying RE, is expected to increase land use conflicts. This is of great concern in particular for vulnerable areas such as the Alps. Reconciling RE expansion with the preservation of natural and cultural values and thus minimizing environmental impacts represents one of the most important challenges now. For this a systematic assessment of the wide range of impacts is needed. This literature review scrutinizes RE resources which are relevant in the Alpine region and their effects on the environment by applying the Ecosystem Service approach. Thereby, we identified possible environmental constraints when exploiting Alpine RE potentials and generated recommendations for future strategies on expanding RE. The outcomes highlight the strong need for interdisciplinary research on RE and environmental conflicts. Interdisciplinary approaches such as the concept of Ecosystem Services can help to cover the wide range of aspects associated with these particular human\textendash environment interrelations.},

Some of these negative impacts may be offset by compensatory payments made by wind developers. Community involvement in the planning and development process may also reduce negative perceptions associated with wind facilities. However, if the development is near a border between municipalities, states, or even countries, it is often the case that one or more jurisdictions will not be involved in the process or receive compensation, but will, nonetheless, face some costs or impacts from the development. We explore exactly this situation at the border between Canada and the United States in the Thousand Islands region where a wind farm is currently operating on the Canadian border island of Wolfe Island. Using a parcel-level hedonic analysis of property sales transactions, we find that properties in New York with a view of and/or in close proximity to the turbines significantly depreciated in value after construction of the turbines while no negative impacts were observed on properties in Ontario. We highlight a number of factors that could contribute to these differences in impacts on property values, which may also explain the variation in results that currently exists in the literature.},

These studies thus rely on the cognitive skills of the respondents to imagine wind turbines of different sizes and at different locations. Based on a theoretical argument, we propose a framework for classifying different visualisation types and utilise it to review recent Stated Preferences (SP) wind power studies. The review is subsequently used to discuss the use of visualisations of wind turbines in the SP studies, highlighting the frequent choice of not using visualisations, as well as the need to raise the bar when designing scenario descriptions for valuation of the visual impacts of wind turbines.},

  abstract = {Man has harnessed the energy in wind for thousands of years, both for sailing boats and powering wind mills at land. Of all renewable energy sources, wind power is the most mature in terms of commercial development. This energy source is interesting because of its renewability and its availability. Potential for development is huge, and the world's capacity is far larger than the world's total energy consumption. Worldwide, a total capacity of about 60 000 MW have been installed, with a yearly production of about 100 TWh. The major challenges for further development are connected to economy, land usage, environment and grid capacity. The growth of renewable energy has been unprecedented over the past 25 years. Wind and solar have maintained double-digit growth rates since 2000. No other segment of the energy sector has grown this fast. Wind power is the most economic new power plant technology, due to reduced installations costs, no fuel costs and construction time of less than one year, compared to over 10 years to construct nuclear power plants. The effects of wind energy on the environment often are considered to be positive, through the production of renewable energy and the potential displacement of mining activities, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions associated with non-renewable energy sources. As a result, a more complete understanding of the environmental and economic effects of any one energy source depends on a more complete understanding of how that energy source displaces or is displaced by other energy sources, and it depends on a more complete understanding of the environmental and economic effects of all other available energy sources. This paper provides analyses to understand those environmental effects, both positive and negative.},

The negative impact increases with the number of wind turbines at a declining marginal rate but declines with distance. In the case of off-shore wind turbine farms, we do not find a significant effect of having an off-shore wind farm in view from a property itself or from the nearest beach, likely because the closest off-shore turbine is 9 km from the closest traded home. We illustrate the policy relevance of our findings by providing maps showing how the marginal impact of a wind turbine varies across the landscape according to the spatial distribution of home density and homes values in the proximity of a wind turbine site. The results suggest that ceteris paribus, wind turbine farms should be built quite far away from residential areas with turbines gathered in larger wind farms rather than installed as single turbines.},

Today most methods and theories on visual impact and cultural heritage within EIA are transferred from disciplines such as landscape architecture, architecture and geography.

In this paper willingness to pay for reducing the visual disamenities from future offshore wind farms is elicited using the economic valuation method Choice Experiments.

Using a fixed effect logit model average willingness to pay amounts were estimated as: 46, 96 and 122 Euros/household/year for having the wind farms located at 12, 18 and 50 km from the coast as opposed to 8 km.

  abstract = {Energy planners have shifted their attention towards offshore wind power generation and the decision is supported by the public in general, which in the literature has a positive attitude towards offshore wind generation. However, globally only a few offshore wind farms are operating. As more wind farms start operating and more people become experienced with especially the visual impacts from offshore wind farms, the public positive attitude could change if the experienced impacts are different from the initially perceived visual interference. Using a binary logit model, the present paper investigates the relation between different levels of prior experience with visual disamenities from offshore wind farms and perception of visual impacts from offshore wind farms. The differences in prior experience are systematically controlled for sampling respondents living in the areas close to the large scale offshore wind farms Nysted and Horns Rev and by sampling the a group of respondents representing the Danish population, which has little experience with offshore wind farms. Compared to previous results in the literature, the present paper finds that perception of wind power generation is influenced by prior experience. More specifically, the results show that people with experience from offshore wind farms located far from the coast have a significant more positive perception of the visual impacts from offshore wind farms than people with experience from wind farms located closer to the coast. These results are noteworthy on two levels. First of all, the results show that perceptions of offshore wind generation are systematically significantly influenced by prior experience with offshore wind farms. Secondly, and in a policy context, the results indicate that the future acceptance of future offshore wind farms is not independent of the location of existing and new offshore wind farms. This poses for caution in relation to locating offshore wind farms too close to the coast.},

However, offshore wind power generation might be a solution to this problem, if the perceived environmental costs are smaller offshore compared with on-land. Based on a review of seven papers focusing on the preferences and willingness to pay for different wind power development sites, people in different countries generally seem to hold significant preferences of offshore wind power development when compared with different types of locations on-land. However, the preferences for offshore wind power development seem to be dependent on the specific place of location offshore. This points towards the fact that offshore locations potentially can have higher environmental costs than on-land locations. However, the preferences for offshore locations strongly indicate that the environmental costs can be significantly reduced by the location of offshore wind farms at large distances from the coast.

  abstract = {The offshore wind power generation market is currently experiencing large growth rates on a global scale and investments exceeding several billion euro are being made. From a welfare economic point of view there is a non-trivial economic trade-off between offshore wind generation costs and the visual impacts from offshore wind farms. Offshore wind farms close to the shore generate cheaper electricity, but also cause higher levels of visual impacts compared to locations at larger distances. In the present paper we carry out a review of the stated preference studies that have elicited the demand for visual disamenity reduction from offshore wind farms. The review has three objectives: (a) to present the results of the different surveys; (b) to explore the more technical parts of the different surveys; and (c) to present the frontiers in the assessment of the demand for visual disamenity reductions associated with offshore wind farm locations. The paper is based on the results from five different studies. The review indicates that locations of offshore wind farms which are close to the shore generate significant welfare losses and that these can be reduced by locating the wind farms at more distant locations. The results also show that the welfare economic costs vary in terms of a range of socio demographic characteristics, experience with wind turbines and recreational activities. Finally, the review suggests that the welfare impacts related to the spatial distribution of the wind farms, intergenerational effects and experience with wind turbines are potential areas that would be beneficial to explore in future studies.},

The ``crowding'' of wind turbines in especially the urban fringe and in more densely populated rural areas is expected to meet resistance. However, few studies have to date analysed the cumulative effects of wind power on the social acceptance of wind power. We shed light on this issue and find that the attitude towards increasing the onshore wind power capacity in Denmark is significantly influenced by the number of turbines people see on a daily basis. However, we find that this effect is conditional on having a wind turbine in the viewshed from the permanent or summer residence. Accordingly, if people cannot see an onshore wind turbine from their permanent or summer residence we do not find significant evidence of cumulative effects on attitude. Furthermore, if we hypothesise that an increase in the wind power capacity is implemented by replacing smaller wind turbines with larger ones, we find that the cumulative effects are reduced also among respondents having onshore wind turbines in the viewshed. This suggests that alternative strategies for increasing the onshore wind power capacity can have significant impact on social acceptance.},

As a result, we observe 48,554 single-family, owner-occupied transactions within five miles of a turbine site, including 3254 within one mile, which is far more than most related studies. We estimate hedonic difference-in-differences models that allow for impacts of wind turbines by proximity, viewshed, and contrast with surrounding development. Across a wide variety of specifications, the results suggest that wind turbines have no statistically significant negative impacts on house prices, in either the post public announcement phase or post construction phase. Further, the lower bound of statistically possible impacts is still outweighed by the positive externalities generated from CO2 mitigation.},

We identify key similarities in acceptance-related patterns of wind energy development across the selected regions, but also important differences, highlighting the very context-specific nature of community acceptance. The findings contribute to improving the understanding of the forces, factors and relationships at play between policy frameworks and perceptions of wind energy under different conditions. We conclude by proposing policy recommendations regarding measures to increase the positive impacts and reduce the negative impacts of wind energy projects, and to strengthen existing drivers and reduce barriers to community acceptance of wind energy development.},

Touristic Complexes and Golf Courses had high visual quality, while Agricultural and Production Areas had high visual fragility. Moreover, the performed analysis made clear that the combined use of landscape assessment methods is suited to this type of study, since it enables quantifying the value of existence, management and maintenance of a particular environmental assets and/or services.},

This paper investigates the public's sensitivities towards these externalities by using discrete choice experiments and shows how preferences differ across inhabitants of our study region. As a further insight into the sources for these variations, a hybrid choice model is employed in order to incorporate individuals' latent attitudes in the estimated model. Our latent class structure allocates individuals to classes according to underlying latent attitudes that also influence the answers to attitudinal questions. We show that these underlying attitudes are a function of a number of socio-demographic characteristics, with young people, men with low income and those living closer to turbines having a stronger pro-wind power generation attitude. The inclusion of the attitudes in the class allocation component of the latent class model leads to a richer picture of people's valuations, revealing, for example, antagonistic preferences of two distinct groups of respondents, i.e. advocates and opponents of wind power generation.},

Due to the relative vicinity with living areas, the installation of an offshore wind farm leads in many cases to public opposition. Therefore, there is still a need to provide planners and decision makers appropriate methods and objective criteria to actually evaluate the visual impact of offshore wind farms. The aim is to provide an intelligible method for visual assessment that can be applied and used within a full decision-aid system oriented towards offshore wind turbines. A visual operator that takes into account the visual distance of an observer located on the ground to the farms layout is introduced. Such operator is based on the aggregation of three different indexes. The horizon occupation is the main index, it evaluates the horizon surface impact. This parameter is modulated by a second index that computes the number of distinguishable turbines and a third index considered as an aesthetic one based on turbine alignments. The whole method is implemented on top of a Geographical Information System (GIS). Overall, the approach provides an estimation of the visual impact without further need for local surveys, it is conceived as a decision-aided mechanism oriented to decision-makers and that can be used at the preliminary steps of the study of an offshore wind farm. The whole approach is experimented in the context of a wind farm in North West France.},

The results indicate a significant effect of visual externalities on welfare estimates in both directions, i.e., a positive effect of visual improvements and a negative effect of deteriorations. This finding corresponds to predictions of the importance of visual impacts in the social science literature. External effects of wind power on biodiversity (mainly birds) do not affect welfare estimates. Indirect externalities caused by conventional sources of electricity that can be avoided by wind power, such as a the reduction of air pollution, do neither have a significant impact on welfare measures. Methodologically, we find substantial but inelastic income effects and, for choice experiments, clear evidence of sensitivity to scope.

In several regions of Germany residents are protesting against setting up new wind turbines. To determine the negative effects two choice experiments were applied in Westsachsen and Nordhessen, Germany. In both regions the externalities of wind power generation until 2020 based on today's state of technology were measured. The results show that negative landscape externalities would result from expanding wind power generation.

Wildfires and human activities are the most important disturbances at landscape-level due to their ecological and socio-economic impacts. The increasing demand which society places on the forest landscapes has led us to develop a tool to identify the economic landscape value around natural protected areas. Our research focused on the integration of social, ecological and economic components of landscape management based on stated social preferences and contingent valuation method (CVM). Landscape value research has been motivated by the need to assist land use planning and environmental management. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) have provided new opportunities to spatially distributed modeling of landscape quality. Correlations were found between the representativeness of the landscape and its sense of belonging, and the contingent rating. Landscape with intensive agricultural practices and mining areas were the least preferred landscapes. There was a notable variation in the economic landscape value attributed to the study area based on the considered CVM scenario, ranging from 1,253,075.1 Euros to 3,650,827.8 Euros. We added the geospatial allocation of willingness to pay according to five landscape quality categories. Our approach could be used to identify priority areas for conservation based on maximizing landscape value, and would be useful in detecting interesting or conflict areas associated with new management and planning alternatives. In this sense, this approach offers managers to seek territorial management strategies to increase economic efficiency in the allocation of resources.},

After the millennium, the impact on landscapes increased, the planning regime failed and economic conditions were worsened with the removal of the fixed feed in tariff. The earlier forerunner country is left in the lee of the internationally boosting wind energy business. From a land use policy view it is interesting to analyse how this has happened and what impact the planning policy has had on the landscape effect of wind energy. In order to analyse the impact of wind turbine development through times and on the population of a region, the present paper analyses by means of geographical information systems and in time steps. The spatial relations between population, landscapes and the wind turbine development from 1982 to 2007 were modelled for the Northern Jutland region by means of proximity, density and visibility analyses.

  abstract = {1. Rural development, and changes in investment under reform of the CAP from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2, seek to establish a new balance between traditional commodity support and payment for the production of non-market goods and services that are increasingly demanded by the public. Landscape is commonly found in the list of public goods associated with agriculture and its preservation and enhancement is deemed to be worth paying for in EU policy. But the precise definition of a landscape, and by extension its composition and value remain elusive. Further, any proactive policies that seek to target landscape conservation or enhancement are somewhat piecemeal in the absence of some consensus definition of the concept that can be unambiguously evaluated. This paper reviews what is known about the concept of landscape and how landscapes are valued. It does so from the perspective of policy decision-making, which is concerned with the need for a value for money evidence base to guide the allocation of public support for the supply of landscape as a public good. This paper briefly considers the history of landscape evaluation methods, followed by a discussion of economic methods of valuing landscape. A review of the valuation literature provides a basis for clarifying what a landscape is and for identifying methodological gaps that may be filled with future research. The main findings are as follows:},

We estimate WTP for forest restoration in Flagstaff, AZ, US (pop. 70,000) using dichotomous-choice Contingent Valuation. Flagstaff, AZ is in a high-altitude, arid region in the Southwestern US surrounded by publicly managed forests with views of mountain peaks. Large-scale forest restoration is proposed within proximity to Flagstaff's city limits. We explicitly model distance to potential treatment area as a determinant of WTP to examine the impact of distance to forest restoration. We further incorporate viewshed into our WTP estimates by controlling for whether a respondent has a mountain peak view. After controlling for viewshed, we find policy-relevant results associated with distance and viewshed. WTP increases as distance to proposed treatment area decreases. However, holding distance constant, respondents with prime mountain peak views are less likely to be WTP for forest restoration. Our results indicate that careful consideration of the complex relationship between distance, viewshed, and WTP is necessary for efficient restoration management decisions.},

In order for this landscape transformation to be sustainable, renewable energy technologies should not cause critical trade-offs between the provision of energy and that of other ecosystem services such as food production. This literature review advances the body of knowledge on sustainable energy transition with special focus on ecosystem services-based approaches and methods. Two key issues emerge from this review: only one sixth of the published applications on the relation between renewable energy and landscape make use of the ecosystem service framework. Secondly, the applications that do address ecosystem services for landscape planning and design lack efficient methods and spatial reference systems that accommodate both cultural and regulating ecosystem services. Future research efforts should be directed to further advancing the spatial reference systems, the use of participatory mapping and landscape visualizations tools for cultural ecosystem services and the elaboration of landscape design principles.},

  abstract = {In many European countries, the most suitable onshore sites for wind installations are almost fully engaged. Furthermore, the existing onshore wind farm capacity should be replaced in the next 10 years because the existing wind power plants are progressively aging in terms of depreciation, degradation and technological obsolescence. Without an adequate policy intervention, the Italian installed wind power capacity would return to the size of 2011 by 2030. In this scenario, the main opportunity for further growth in wind energy generation is wind farm enlargement. The aim of this paper is to assess the welfare change due to the proposed enlargement project. First, we investigate whether existing wind farms affect respondents' attitude and perception toward the potential enlargement of the wind farm by using the contingent valuation method. Second, we investigate the perception of the risk associated with the enlargement of a wind farm. In this case, we explicitly consider respondents' heterogeneity in perceiving the new project externalities. To achieve this objective, we use willingness to pay and willingness to accept measure to appraise welfare change due to the enlargement project. Each of these measures has been elicited jointly regarding the respective appraised externality impact perceived by the respondents. The individual and aggregate findings of this research can offer useful insights for planning and design enlargement schemes to achieve further growth in wind energy generation.},

A questionnaire survey analyzed beach users' preferences, judgment, and Willingness to Pay (WTP). Results suggest that landscape judgment is directly correlated to scenery assessment; therefore, beaches of Class I and II were judged beautiful while beaches of Class IV and V had poor judgments. Similarly, the importance given to the landscape was highest in Class I and II than in the others. WTP for the conservation of the selected beaches was about \texteuro 16 per season. Our findings suggest that people are disposed to pay more for a beach with the top-grade of scenery (Class I and II) and low grade of urbanization.

Scenic values were calculated for 25 sites along Italian coastline using of a Coastal Scenic Evaluation System (CSES), a fuzzy logic containing 26 physical/human factors. The sites were categorized into five classes from Class I (top grade scenery) to Class V (poor scenery). Furthermore, a survey through questionnaires on Users' Perception (UP) was performed to obtain social assessment of the beaches and to define the beachgoer's characteristics for each scenic class. Five parameters (beach cleanliness, sea-water, beach width, landscape and crowding) were also combined to obtain a scenic and social analysis of the beaches. Three beaches belonged to Class I, e.g. remote or resort areas with a low impact of human activities and high score of natural parameters. Two Class II beaches were located at remote or rural areas having sand beaches, turquoise water and vigorous vegetation together with a low impact of tourist developments. Classes III, IV and V presented a wide distribution and their lower scores were linked to a poor environmental setting. These beaches were generally located in urban localities. Three aspects that were considered by the beach's users as the most important were beach cleanliness, good sea water and high quality of the services. However, UP assessment showed negative judgments on sea-water and landscape especially for Class IV and V beaches. On the other hand, cleanliness, recreational activities and facilities were well-judged for the Class III, IV and V beaches mainly due to the presence of private beach establishments. Scenic and social analysis of the beaches indicated that beach width was the best parameter both for scenic and social assessment; while crowding factor was a contradictory parameter presenting opposite trends of CSES and UP. Beach cleanliness, sea-water and landscape were depended to scenic Class of the beaches, both for CSES and UP. The excellent scenic values were associated to the environmental settings whereas human parameters usually showed low scores especially for urban beaches due to marine litter and the presence of coastal defense structures like groins and breakwaters. Nevertheless, users frequented both beaches with high and low parameters, due to their habitually frequentation and proximity to the beach. Finally, the results indicate that management strategies are also needed to improve the scenic quality and users' judgement of some beach features.},

The greatest obstacle when it comes to the acceptance of wind farms is their visual impact. Recently, tourism has become Iceland's largest export sector, the country's natural landscape being the main attraction for visitors. This paper attempts to compare the perception of residents and tourists towards wind energy production in general and towards Iceland's first proposed wind farm, to be located at the edge of the country's uninhabited interior Central Highlands. The study is based on a questionnaire survey conducted among residents living adjacent to the proposed wind farm and among tourists travelling through the proposed area. The results indicate that residents are more positive than tourists towards wind turbines and consider them less intrusive in the landscape. Hence, the location of Iceland's first wind farm at the main gateway into the country's Central Highlands is problematic and likely to disturb the experience of tourists passing through the area. Despite the wealth of wind in Iceland it might be challenging to utilize it for energy production due to the importance of nature-based tourism for the economy. If Iceland becomes a physical exporter of renewable energy, it may be expected that more pressure will be set on the construction of wind farms. Thereby nature-based tourism and wind energy would be in direct competition over land use.},

This transformation of the landscape, in spite of the good social acceptance of solar energy, causes an aesthetic impact whose interest has been growing in literature in recent years. This study aimed to review prior literature in order to establish the objective factors, aesthetic perception and methods that are most relevant when assessing the aesthetic impact. As a result of the lack of consensus, a new qualitative methodological framework is proposed that can serve as a basis for future research in the field of the integration of solar energy and its aesthetic impact. The framework comprises three sub-impacts: land use, solar system energy and glare. The results are discussed for future research and innovation in building photovoltaic integration and for SES site location and its environmental impact assessments.},

  abstract = {In this paper we present welfare estimates from a contingent valuation (CV) study which investigates the potential benefits derived by tourists from the implementation of a programme aimed at preserving the traditional agricultural landscape in a typical Mediterranean area: the National Park of Cilento (Southern Italy). Here, under current market conditions, farming activities are being gradually abandoned. As a result, the alternative to the cultivated landscape is a much less appealing one, where the various stages of progression of land abandonment dominate. To ease the cognitive task of respondents, CV responses were elicited using the discrete choice referendum format. To supplement the inherent inefficiency of discrete choice responses one follow-up question was also administered. The sample responses are analysed by three methods. First, by a log-normal model which allows a random utility interpretation. Then by a series of beta models, which require the definition of the maximum in the range of willingness to pay and reflect a purely statistical approach. Finally, by means of the non-parametric Kaplan-Meier-Turnbull probability estimates, which is robust to potential parametric mis-specifications. The welfare estimates obtained by various methods were similar and approached one Euro per day-visit. Our results indicate that referendum CV provides plausible estimates of WTP for agricultural landscape conservation from the tourists' population. From a conservative inference it appears that in 1997 the traditional farming produced a landscape externality for tourists which reached at least 8 million Euro. Provision of landscape is only one of many unremunerated activities provided by farmers, so more research should be aimed at valuing public goods produced by farming in recreationally valuable areas and elsewhere. We argue that the policy tools currently employed in the European Common Agricultural Policy, for the purpose of rural landscape preservation, are inadequate in the context of typical Mediterranean agriculture. Here the main cause of rural landscape deterioration seems to be the abandonment of agricultural production, rather than its intensification, so the main features of interest are other than those currently protected by EU policy.},

Based on an Austrian case study, this paper investigates eight decisive patterns of acceptance and non-acceptance of wind energy. We apply qualitative research methods, such as interviews, focus groups, and WorldCaf\'e discussions, with stakeholders on the national level and with citizens and local decision-makers at potential wind power expansion sites. The results show that local opposition to wind energy cannot be explained by single factors but is caused by a complex set of individual and collective preferences rooted in institutional and socio-political arrangements. The problem concerning these conflicting patterns is that they are trapped in often opposing or confronting policy core beliefs, which are unlikely to change. Hence, it is necessary to appeal to overarching targets like the claims of environmental justice to counterbalance the impacts of wind energy. We conclude that there is a strong demand for fair decision-making processes and an equal distribution of environmental and economic gains and losses.},

  abstract = {Mountain regions meet an increasing demand for pleasant landscapes, offering many cultural ecosystem services to both their residents and tourists. As a result of global change, land managers and policy makers are faced with changes to this landscape and need efficient evaluation techniques to assess cultural ecosystem services. This study provides a spatially explicit modelling approach to estimating aesthetic landscape values by relating spatial landscape patterns to human perceptions via a photo-based survey. The respondents attributed higher aesthetic values to the Alpine landscape in respect to areas with settlements, infrastructure or intensive agricultural use. The aesthetic value of two study areas in the Central Alps (Stubai Valley, Austria and Vinschgau, Italy) was modelled for 10,215 viewpoints along hiking trails according to current land cover and a scenario considering the spontaneous reforestation of abandoned land. Viewpoints with high aesthetic values were mainly located at high altitude, allowing long vistas, and included views of lakes or glaciers, and the lowest values were for viewpoints close to streets and in narrow valleys with little view. The aesthetic values of the reforestation scenario decreased mainly at higher altitudes, but the whole area was affected, reducing aesthetic value by almost 10\% in Stubai Valley and 15\% in Vinschgau. Our proposed modelling approach allows the estimation of aesthetic values in spatial and qualitative terms for most viewpoints in the European Alps. The resulting maps can be used as information and the basis for discussion by stakeholders, to support the decision-making process and landscape planning. This paper also discusses the role of mountain farming in preserving an attractive landscape and related cultural values.},

Criticism focuses primarily on the visual impact of wind turbines and transmission lines, which may result in perceived deterioration of the landscape and also harm other economic activities such as tourism and real estate. This study applies the hedonic pricing method to estimate the value of environmental externalities associated with large-scale exploitation of wind power at a local level. It examines the characteristics of approximately 1,800 sales of single-family homes surrounding 17 existing wind facilities in two Greek islands, namely Evia and Kefalonia. Four different hedonic price models are developed and applied, with diverging results in the two areas. We find that in Evia, the per unit floor area sales price decreased for dwellings located within a 2 km radius of the wind farms, while in Kefalonia, the distance of the house to the wind turbines had no statistically significant effect on the sales price.},

In contrast to the traditional negative notion to\- wards the visual impact of BIPV, ``aesthetic BIPV'' may even enhance the integration quality and produce a positive visual impact. Therefore, this research aims to objectively quantify the visual impact of BIPV in the built environment and clarifies its quality at the same time. The objective VIA approach is developed based on saliency mapping, a computer vision technique predicting human visual attention. As a case study, the proposed meth\- odology is implemented to evaluate the perceived visual impact of a retrofitted coloured BIPV on four selected building frontages along Orchard Road in Singapore. Subjective surveys are implemented to validate the objective results, in which ratings of the visual impact of BIPV are collected based on the comparative street views with and without BIPV applications. Through validation, the proposed objective VIA methodology was determined as ``qualified'' for predicting the visual impact of BIPV. The proposed method can be applied as a planning or building design tool for urban planners and architects to objectively predict the visual impact of BIPV at the preliminary design stage.},

  abstract = {Wind power is the most important renewable energy source in many countries today, characterized by a rapid and extensive diffusion since the 1990s. However, it has also triggered much debate with regard to the impact on landscape and vista. Therefore, siting processes of wind farm projects are often accompanied by massive public protest, because of visual and aural impacts on the surrounding area. These mostly negative consequences might be reflected in property values and house prices. The aim of this paper is to investigate the impacts of wind farms on the surrounding area through property values, by means of a hedonic pricing model, using both a spatial fixed (viewshed) effects (accounting for spatially clustered unobserved influences) and a Geographically Weighted Regression model (accounting for spatial heterogeneity). The analysis is the first of its kind undertaken for a local region in Continental Europe (North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany). Viewsheds are calculated for each property using a digital surface model. Focusing on proximity and visibility effects caused by wind farm sites, we find that proximity, measured by the inverse distance to the nearest wind turbine, indeed causes significant negative impacts on the surrounding property values. Thereby, local statistics reveal varying spatial patterns of the coefficient estimates across and within the city areas and districts. In contrast, no evidence is found for a statistically significant impact of the visibility of the wind farm turbines.},

  abstract = {Today's investment decisions in large-scale onshore wind projects in Germany are no longer determined only by the investment's economic benefit, but also by concerns associated to social acceptance. Despite a mostly positive attitude towards the expansion of wind power, local public concerns often stem from the belief that the proximity to large-scale wind farms may lead to a decrease in property prices. In particular, the change in landscape caused by the construction of a wind farm may have an adverse impact on the view from some properties, and thus may negatively affect their price. To investigate the potential devaluation of properties in Germany due to wind farms, we use a quasi-experimental technique and apply a spatial difference-in-differences approach to various wind farm sites in the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. We adopt a quantitative visual impact assessment approach to account for the adverse environmental effects caused by the wind turbines. To properly account for spatial dependence and unobserved variables biases, we apply augmented spatial econometric models. The estimates indicate that the asking price for properties whose view was strongly affected by the construction of wind turbines decreased by about 9\textendash 14\%. In contrast, properties with a minor or marginal view on the wind turbines experienced no devaluation.},

To overcome this problem, we suggest a multidisciplinary approach that integrates landscape ecology, landscape preference studies and environmental economics to provide a common framework for collaboration between landscape scientists and economists. Within this approach, firstly a parametric landscape procedure is used to organize the spatial information on landscape by identifying landscape types and quantifying their attributes. Secondly, these indicators are used as explanatory variables in a Choice Experiment of individuals' preferences for landscape, to assess the economic value that people attach to different landscape attributes. The economic values thus estimated are of particular interest to policy makers as they express the monetary benefits that society receives from landscape and its characteristics. Such values can then be used in cost benefit analyses for evaluating public programs affecting landscape and its features. \textcopyright{} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Solar energy for the production of electric energy is one source of renewable energy which is experiencing most development in recent years. In countries with high solar radiation indices, as is the case of Spain, expectations of installation of large solar power plants are increasing. Most solar power plants are located in rural environments, where the landscape has remained practically unaltered ever since extensive agriculture was introduced. Because of this, one of the most significant environmental impacts of this type of installation is the visual impact derived from the alteration of the landscape. In this work, an indicator is proposed for the quantification of the objective aesthetic impact, based on four criteria: visibility, colour, fractality and concurrence between fixed and mobile panels. The relative importance of each variable and the corresponding value functions are calculated using expert contribution. A study of the subjective aesthetic impact is then carried out using the semantic differential method, to obtain the perception of a sample of individuals of the initial landscapes and of the landscapes altered through the installation of a solar power plant. The indicator and the study of public perception are applied to five real solar power plants, to test their reliability. Subsequently, a different group of individuals is used to determine preferences between the five solar power plants. The study proves that the combined use of objective indicator and subjective study, faithfully explains user preferences corresponding to the combined comparisons of the five cases. It is concluded that the tools proposed for the evaluation of the aesthetic impact of solar power plants are useful for the selection of optimal plant location and most adequate use of panel technology, to minimise aesthetic impact.},

This paper identifies six `variables' that can hamper the comparison between different public perception studies, and offers two broad conclusions. On aggregate, proximity does have strong influence on public attitudes to proposed projects, but the nature, strength and spatial scale of this effect may vary according to local context and `value' of the land. Residents of stigmatised places are more likely to welcome facilities that are relatively `green', while people who derive a more positive sense of identity from particular rural landscapes are likely to resist such potential developments, especially if they also live there. Secondly, the fear of being branded a NIMBY, and the positive ethics associated with the notion of renewable are both likely to `colour' the responses of many interviewees. These aspects need to be clarified and accounted for in analyses of elicited responses, both quantitative and qualitative, if we are to improve our understanding of the social construction of individual attitudes in siting conflicts.},

Despite the vast amount of case studies, preferences for landscape attributes are context specific, which inhibits cross-case comparison and up-scaling. In this study, we address this problem by applying a meta-analysis of stated preference studies that focus on attributes of European agrarian landscapes (n= 345). The main objective of this study is to identify generic preferences for particular types of landscape attributes across case studies. In addition, landscape context variables that explain preference heterogeneity between different cases that address similar landscape attributes are identified. We find that landscape attributes that describe mosaic land cover, historic buildings or the presence of livestock generally receive the highest stated preferences across cases. Furthermore, we find relations between preferences for particular attributes and context variables - such as population density and GDP per capita - using a meta-regression analysis. The results of the present study provide the first cross-disciplinary and cross-case evidence on relations between preferences for landscape attributes and socio-economic and landscape context conditions. The study is a first step toward up-scaling of landscape preferences and the development social landscape indicators that reflect the perceived value of landscapes at regional and pan-regional scales, which is increasingly important as landscape policies are progressively implemented at European level.},

These values are shaped by the aesthetic, cultural, and recreational benefits and services provided by those landscapes. However, across the globe, processes such as urbanization, agricultural intensification, and abandonment are threatening landscape integrity, altering the personally meaningful connections people have toward specific places. Existing methods used to study landscape values, such as social surveys, are poorly suited to capture dynamic landscape-scale processes across large geographic extents. Social media data, by comparison, can be used to indirectly measure and identify valuable features of landscapes at a regional, continental, and perhaps even worldwide scale. We evaluate the usefulness of different social media platforms - Panoramio, Flickr, and Instagram - and quantify landscape values at a continental scale. We find Panoramio, Flickr, and Instagram data can be used to quantify landscape values, with features of Instagram being especially suitable due to its relatively large population of users and its functional ability of allowing users to attach personally meaningful comments and hashtags to their uploaded images. Although Panoramio, Flickr, and Instagram have different user profiles, our analysis revealed similar patterns of landscape values across Europe across the three platforms. We also found variables describing accessibility, population density, income, mountainous terrain, or proximity to water explained a significant portion of observed variation across data from the different platforms. Social media data can be used to extend our understanding of how and where individuals ascribe value to landscapes across diverse social, political, and ecological boundaries.},

  abstract = {This thesis presents two distinct participative approaches, qualitative the first and monetary the second to analyse people preferences for landscape management. The first approach analyses people opinions about the impact of some specific landscape elements on the landscape of a protected wetland area in northern Italy, while the second applies a stated preference technique, choice experiments, for the valuation of the benefits of different potential landscape settings of a urban forest near Venice. Embracing the definition of landscape provided by the European Landscape Convention that defines landscape as "perceived by people" suggesting to apply participative approaches in the development of landscape policies, the objectives of this thesis are: 1) verify if the preferences expressed by means of opinions in the absence of visual stimuli are similar to those expressed by scoring images; 2) analyse the effect of the presence/absence of some elements on the preferences of the two groups of respondents; 3) to understand whether choice experiments can be structured (designed) to value landscape providing both welfare estimates and planning support, objectives that are usually achieved applying two distinct approaches: a stated preference valuation (either contingent valuation or choice experiments) and a perceptive study The thesis consists of two main parts: the first part (chapters 1, 2 and 3) presents the theoretical framework for understanding the need to value landscape, its contextualisation in economic theory and the main valuation methodologies that can be applied to its valuation with particular focus on choice experiments. The second part of this work (chapters 4 and 5) is devoted to the presentation of the results obtained from the application of the two valuation approaches to the two case study.},

According to our results the majority of people perceive wind energy positively and prefer offshore wind farms. People recognise the importance of preserving landscape and think that wind turbines do not improve its beauty. In this respect the installation of new wind farms can be considered a secondbest solution in terms of landscape preservation, but a first-best solution if other aspects are taken into account.},

Scarce wild land areas on islands may be particularly vulnerable to landscape-scale degradation; this may have serious negative societal impacts. Samothraki's resident perceptions were surveyed in the wake of such a proposal, in June 2018. Of 98 respondents, 48\% reported they were against the wind farm plan, while 22\% did not take sides. We compare for-and-against sub-group perceptions of the proposed wind farm with potential impacts on the landscape and explore residents' opinions on ecosystem services and environmental pressures and threats. Conflict over the wind farm was prevalent; residents most frequently reported that the proposal threatens aesthetic and landscape qualities. Aesthetic qualities were also the second highest ranked ecosystem services, after freshwater provision. However, other threats, such as livestock overgrazing, top residents' opinion of major environmental problems on the island. The questionnaire survey used provides a scoping assessment, which may assist in identifying ``conflict hotspots'' for wind farm development. A critical review of wind farm planning in protected areas is presented in light of insights gained from this survey and other relevant studies.},

  abstract = {Despite the great potential of mitigating carbon emission, development of wind farms is often opposed by local communities due to the visual impact on landscape. A growing number of studies have applied nonmarket valuation methods like Choice Experiments (CE) to value the visual impact by eliciting respondents' willingness to pay (WTP) or willingness to accept (WTA) for hypothetical wind farms through survey questions. Several metaanalyses have been found in the literature to synthesize results from different valuation studies, but they have various limitations related to the use of the prevailing multivariate meta-regression analysis. In this paper, we propose a new meta-analysis method to establish general functions for the relationships between the estimated WTP or WTA and three wind farm attributes, namely the distance to residential/coastal areas, the number of turbines and turbine height. This method involves establishing WTA or WTP functions for individual studies, fitting the average derivative functions and deriving the general integral functions of WTP or WTA against wind farm attributes. Results indicate that respondents in different studies consistently showed increasing WTP for moving wind farms to greater distances, which can be fitted by non-linear (natural logarithm) functions. However, divergent preferences for the number of turbines and turbine height were found in different studies. We argue that the new analysis method proposed in this paper is an alternative to the mainstream multivariate meta-regression analysis for synthesizing CE studies and the general integral functions of WTP or WTA against wind farm attributes are useful for future spatial modelling and benefit transfer studies. We also suggest that future multivariate meta-analyses should include non-linear components in the regression functions.},

  abstract = {The paper is focused on the value of the European mountain landscape/ecosystem and evaluates the impact of agriculture and agricultural policy on the value of this public good. Based on the meta-analysis of 22 landscape/ecosystem valuation studies, it was found that the average value of the European mountain landscape/ecosystem is 3,068 EUR per hectare per year, and 3.91 EUR per person per day. However, there are regions with a significantly higher value \textendash{} Tatra in Poland and Alpujarran in Spain. The value is influenced by the position of agriculture in the national economy. Higher values of the mountain landscape/ ecosystem were achieved in countries where the contribution of agriculture to the gross value added is above average. On the other hand, there is no significant relationship between the proportion of farming in the LFA and the value of the mountain landscape/ecosystem. Public support was found to be insufficient to cover the cost of landscape services performed by farmers. Keywords},

  abstract = {This paper provides a literature review on wind power and externalities from multiple perspectives. Specifically, the economic rationale behind world-wide wind power deployment is to mitigate negative externalities of conventional electricity technologies, notably emissions from fossil fuels. However, wind power entails externalities itself. Wind turbines can lower quality of human life through noise and visual impacts, and threaten wildlife. Variable wind electricity can impose additional costs within the electricity system. Locally and nationally, employment, output, and security of electricity supply can be affected. Assembling evidence from diverse strands of research, this literature review provides a structured account of external and indirect costs, both mitigated and imposed.},

  abstract = {Power plants based on renewable sources offer environmental, technical and economic advantages. Of particular importance is the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared to conventional power plants. Despite the advantages, people are often opposed to the construction of these facilities due to their high visual impact, particularly if they are close to places with a great cultural and/or landscape value. This paper proposes a new methodology for identifying the most suitable geographical areas for the construction of new photovoltaic (PV) power plants in zones of special scenic or cultural interest, helping to keep the environment free from the visual intrusions caused by these facilities. From several repeated analyses, the degree of visibility of the new PV plant, the potential observation time of passing visitors, considering the route they follow and their speed, and the increase in visibility of the plants when seen totally or partially with the sky as background, are determined. The result obtained is a map showing the ranking of the geographical areas based on a variable calculated in such analyses: the Global Accumulated Perception Time (GAPT). The application of this methodology can help the different agents involved in the decision-making process for the installation of new PV plant by providing them with an objective visibility criterion.},
